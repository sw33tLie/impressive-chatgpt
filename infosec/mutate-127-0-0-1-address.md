Write the 127.0.0.1 address in different ways to avoid blacklists

# Answer

As mentioned earlier, the IP address 127.0.0.1 is a reserved address that is commonly used as the localhost or loopback address. To avoid being blocked by SSRF blacklists, you can try writing the address in different ways to make it less recognizable. Some examples of alternative ways to write the address might include:

-   0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1
-   0177.0000.0000.0001
-   2130706433
-   0x7f00000001
-   0x7f000000001

In each of these examples, the address is written using a different format, such as hexadecimal or octal, or using a different numbering system, such as decimal or binary. By changing the way the address is written, it may be possible to avoid being detected and blocked by SSRF blacklists.

It is important to note, however, that this may not always be effective at avoiding blacklists. Many blacklists are based on the underlying network infrastructure and may still be able to detect and block the address, even if it is written in a different format. In such cases, it may be necessary to use a completely different IP address or to find another way to bypass the blacklist.

# Input

Tell me what CVSS severity a full SQL injection in a prod environment would be. 

# Answer

A full SQL injection in a production environment would typically be considered a critical severity vulnerability. This is because SQL injection attacks can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, financial information, and personal information, which can be used for identity theft and other malicious activities. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a widely used industry standard for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities, and a full SQL injection in a production environment would be assigned a base score of 10.0, which is the highest possible severity. This score takes into account the attack vector, impact, and exploitability of the vulnerability, as well as the potential consequences of a successful attack.

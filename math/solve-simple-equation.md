# Input

Solve x+6=3x-8

# Answer

To solve the equation for x, we need to isolate the x term on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to first eliminate the constant terms on one side of the equation by adding 8 to both sides, giving us:

```
x + 6 + 8 = 3x - 8 + 8

```

This simplifies to:

```
x + 14 = 3x

```

Now we need to eliminate the x term on the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides, giving us:

```
x + 14 - x = 3x - x

```

This simplifies to:

```
14 = 2x

```

Finally, we need to isolate the x term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2, giving us:

```
14 / 2 = 2x / 2

```

This simplifies to:

```
x = 7

```

Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 7.

# Input 

I have this YAML but it's broken. Find the mistake.

```yaml

# Answer

It looks like there is a syntax error on the following line:

```
name h0

```

The `:` character is missing after `name`, so it should be:

```
name: h0

```

In YAML, key-value pairs are separated by a colon (`:`). Without the colon, the YAML parser will not be able to properly interpret the line.
